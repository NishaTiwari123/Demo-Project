      Content itself is what the user derives value from. Thus, "content" can
      refer to the information provided through the medium, the way in which the
      information was presented, as well as the added features included in the
      medium in which that information was delivered. The medium, however,
      provides little to no value to the end-user without the information and
      experiences that make up the content. Communication theory philosopher
      Marshall McLuhan famously coined the phrase, "The medium is the message."
      In the case of content, the channel through which information is
      delivered, the "medium", affects how the end user perceives content, the
      "message". Another important thing about content, especially when it comes
      to professional content writing, is the value that you deliver. Unless
      your content is useful to the readers, it is not going to be useful to you
      or your brand. The author, producer, or publisher of an original source of
      information or experiences may or may not be directly responsible for the
      entire value that they attain as content in a specific context. For
      example, part of an original article (such as a headline from a news
      story) may be rendered on another web page displaying the results of a
      user's search engine query grouped with headlines from other news
      publications and related advertisements. The value that the original
      headline has in this group of query results from the search engine as a
      medium may be very different from the value that it had as message content
      in its original article. Content also leads to influencing other people in
      creating their own content, sometimes in a way that the original author
      did not or could not plan or imagine. This feature, adding the option of
      user innovation in a medium, means that users can develop their own
      content from existing content. Much social media content is derived in
      this way, by effectively re-cycling content in a slightly different
      format. Technological effects on content Traditionally, content was edited
      and tailored to the public through news editors, authors, and other kinds
      of content creators. However, not all information content requires
      creative authoring or editing. Through recent technological developments,
      truth is found in philosopher Marshall McLuhan's idea of a global village;
      new technologies allow for instantaneous movement of information from
      every corner to every point at the same time[4] causing the globe to be
      contracted into a village by electric technology,[5] such as smartphones
      and automated sensors. These new technologies can record events anywhere
      for publishing and converting in order to potentially reach a global
      audience through various internet channels such as YouTube. Such recorded
      or transmitted information and visuals can be referred to as content.
      Content is no longer a product of only reputable sources; new technology
      has made primary sources of content more readily available to all.
